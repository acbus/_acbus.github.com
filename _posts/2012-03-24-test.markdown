---

This is the first blog post from ACBuS.

ACBuS is an free software and open hardware project made for sniffing automotive protocols like CAN, FlexRay. Initial goal of the project is to bring up CANsniff. Once it is running, FlexRaySniff will come into action.

ACBuS initial project CANsniff will be tested on the <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/evalboard/product/252419.jsp"> STM32F4DISCOVERY </a>. This evaluation board contains a very powerful STM32 ARM Cortex M4 controller. The software development will be on STM32F4DISCOVERY. Parallely a new hardware will be designed using <a href="http://www.geda-project.org/"> gEDA </a>.
