		<h1>ACBuS</h1>
		<p>ACBuS is an open source hardware based automotive communication bus sniffer made for sniffing and also analysisng protocols like CAN, FlexRay etc. Complete source code and hardware designs of this project are freely available.</p>
		<p>The protocols used for communication in automotives are open and well documentation is available in the Internet. But the traffic analyser for such automotive protocols are costlier and not open. This project aims to design such protocol analyser for sniffing and analysing the automotive communication bus traffic and tools for analysing them.</p>
