		<h1>ACBuS</h1>
		<p>ACBuS is an open source hardware based automotive communication bus sniffer made for sniffing and also analysing protocols like CAN, FlexRay etc. Complete source code and hardware designs of this project are freely available.</p>
		<p>The protocols used for communication in automotives are open and well documentation is available in the Internet. But the analyser(hardware and software) for such automotive protocols are costlier and not open. This project aims to design such protocol analyser for sniffing and analysing the automotive communication bus traffic. You can find a complete list of projects from <a  href="http://freedomdefined.org/OSHW">ACBuS projects</a> page.</p>
		<p>The main target will be to build complete open hardware based automotive communication protocol ananlyser hardware. With the openness of the project, anyone can use the design available here for further modification and better development of this project. A minimalistic software will be available for the analysis of the measurement on the host(PC) side. Initial priority is for the hardware development. Once the hardware and its associated software firmware is running, the analyser software on the host side will be developed.</p>
		<p>All device firmware and host software source code is released under GNU General Public License.  The hardware design (schematics, PCB) is released under "Creative Commons share-alike attribution" License.</p>
