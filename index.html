		<h1>ACBuS</h1>
		<p>ACBuS is an open source hardware based automotive communication bus sniffer(analyser) made for sniffing protocols like CAN, FlexRay etc. Complete source code and hardware designs are freely available.</p>
		<p>The protocols used for communication in automotives are open and well documentation is available in the Internet. But the analyser for such protocols are costly and not open. This project aims to design such protocol analyser for sniffing the automotive communication bus traffic and tools for analysing them.</p>
